This module is meant to provide basic functions for network management.
NB: Currently only for IPv4

First compile library:
$ gcc -fPIC -c inet.c

Then compile the example:
$ gcc -o inet_example inet_example.c inet.o

After running the example, similar to the following will print to screen:
Converted to sockaddr_in
Converted IP 192.168.2.1
Converted Port 6048
DNS server 127.0.0.53
Interface lo
        IP 127.0.0.1
Interface ens160
        IP 192.168.2.207


You can alternatively do this without compiling the library and simply including inet.c in the compile instead of inet.o
See example for use.
